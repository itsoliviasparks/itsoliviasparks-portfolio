            "In the fashion industry, it's called a Technical Designer or a Product Developer.",

            "Before I began my coding career, I spent half a decade working in fashion industry as a Technical Designer:",

            "In this position, I collaborated closely with internal design, sourcing, and QA teams, as well as third-party factories, to develop more than 60 products per quarter. My role was integral to the development process: the design team would provide me with sketches of their desired collection, and it was my responsibility to transform these sketches into fully functional, production-ready products.",

            "Throughout the development process, I analyzed user-submitted data and led focus groups to guide product improvements. I worked within tight timing and budget constraints, managed the expectations of cross-functional team members, and tracked product development using the industry's version control equivalent. Additionally, my role involved presenting my ideas and work to both my cross-functional peers and the brand's leadership team. To do this, I led weekly collaborative working sessions with my peers to align on each style. I also summarized and presented high-level key takeaways to the company's leadership team for their buy-in prior to the implementation of finalized products and customer research.",
