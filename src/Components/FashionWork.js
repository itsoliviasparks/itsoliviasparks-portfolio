                My “there must be a better way” ethos also contributed to my 5+ year track record of solving user-focus problems in my past-life as a Technical Apparel Developer.

                My main focus in this role was to execute the design team's vision of each season's collection while protecting & improving best-in-class <strong>fit & function</strong> of each garment (read: user-experience). My work was iterative, and involved weekly research to <strong>identify user pain points</strong>— <em>Is it warm enough? Is the pocket in an intuitive place? Can you sit down comfortably? Does it fit as expected?</em>

                From there, I would <strong>research, prototype, & test solutions before sending the best solution to stores</strong> (read: push to production). User experience was quantified in True To Size (TTS) ratings & calculated from online reviews. I improved the user experience by 9% to an average of 94% TTS.
